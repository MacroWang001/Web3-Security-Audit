# The Pledge

I solemnly swear, that I will never place a private key or secret phrase or mnemonic in a .env file that is associated with real funds.

I will only place private keys in a .env file that have ONLY testnet ETH, LINK, or other cryptocurrencies.

When I'm testing and developing, I will use a different wallet than the one associated with my real funds.

I am aware that if I forget a .gitignore and push my key/phrase up to GitHub even for a split-second, or show my key/phrase to the internet for a split second, it should be considered compromised and I should move all my funds immediately.

If I am unsure if my account has real funds in it, I will assume it has real funds in it. If I assume it has real funds in it, I will not use it for developing purposes.

I am aware that even if I hit add account on my metamask (or other ETH wallet) I will get a new private key, but it will share the same secret phrase/mnemonic of the other accounts generated in that metamask (or other ETH wallet).
